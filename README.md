Stellina status display

This repo is a depository for my initial thoughts on a Stellina status display (and maybe control in future).

If you don't know what Stellina is, it is an automated refractor telescope and astrograph made by the French company Vaonis.

Normally this telescope is controlled from a mobile phone or tablet. But sometimes we want to know more about how things work,
what observations have been made, why they failed, a record of settings used such as RA and DEC.

This software uses http:// protocol, it should not damage your telescope which is controlled internally by a Raspberry-PI.
However, by using this software you take all responsibility for what happens to your expensive instrument.
